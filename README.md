*"Your primitive human words amuse me!"* - Zog-7, probably

![Alien Chatbot Demo](demo.gif) *(Add a screen recording later)*

A hybrid chatbot that combines:
- **Rule-based responses** for basic interactions
- **OpenAI magic** for alien-level sass
- **Tkinter GUI** because even aliens appreciate good UX

## 🚀 Features

| Feature | Description | Emoji Verdict |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Alien Personality** | Sarcastic Xylophonian with broken English | 👽✔️ |
| **Hybrid Intelligence** | Rules + OpenAI = Best of both worlds | 🧠⚡ |
| **Windows-Friendly** | No more `charmap` errors! (Mostly) | 🪟✅ |
| **Rate Limited** | Won't bankrupt your OpenAI credits | 💰🚦 |

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone this intergalactic masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/ALMAFLEHI/python-chatbot.git
cd python-chatbot

# Install dependencies (Earth units required)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download NLTK data (Zog-7 needs this to parse your puny language)
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"


🔧 Configuration
-----------------
# Set your OpenAI API key (don't worry, Zog-7 won't judge you
Create .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Get from: https://platform.openai.com/

💡 Pro Tip: If you skip this, Zog-7 will default to "cosmic static" mode (dumb responses)


💻 Usage
--------
# Fancy GUI Mode (Recommended for humans)
python gui.py

# CLI Mode (For terminal purists)
python app.py



Sample Conversation:

You: How old are you?
Zog-7: *antennae wiggle* Time is illusion! On Xylophon we measure age in quantum fizzles!
